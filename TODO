packet:
    - decode()
      o new: no TYPE_header_new(), directly call header_storage_new(&storage);
        ==> less function calls (for debugging purpose it's ok for now)
        maybe export (extern) storage and don't use new() anymore resp. remove new()
      o free: can't be reduced. must be recursively used => function pointer
